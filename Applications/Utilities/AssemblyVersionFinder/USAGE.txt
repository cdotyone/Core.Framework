AssemblyVersionFinder: Searches a project structure or an assembly 
                       for an AssemblyFileVersion.
Author: Chris Doty <cdoty@civicinc.com>

AssemblyVersionFinder.exe [option] [path]

Options: 
	-d - (Default) Forces scan of a project structure.  It will search all .cs 
	     files for this pattern [assembly: AssemblyFileVersion("1.0.0.0")].
		 will return 1.0.0.0 in this example.
	
	-a - Tells AssemblyVersionFinder.exe we want to look at a specific .exe or 
	     .dll file

	-s - forces output of a version# with just major and minor.  So instead of 
	     1.0.0.0 it would return 1.0

	-b - forces output of a version# with just build and revision.  So instead
	     of 1.0.0.0 it would return 0.0

Path:
	Can be the path to the directory to scan or the assembly path.
	By default it will search the current working directory.  If the current 
	working directory is the bin or under the bin directory the project root 
	folder will be used
